Getting started
---------------

To get you started on the challenge quickly, we have created some 
bootstrapping scripts to make things easier.

In plain language all you need to do is create a virtualenv [#]_ and
run the bootstrap target with make.

A detailed step by step description is:

::

    $ sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    $ sudo apt install -y git build-essential python3-dev python3-virtualenv
    $ cd 002_fun_coding_time
    $ virtualenv --python=python3 venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    $ make bootstrap

When is done, you have the environment is ready for running!
