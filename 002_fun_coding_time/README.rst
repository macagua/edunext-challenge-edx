This application is a PayPal Payment Processor via a REST API provided
for the eduNEXT Backend developer challenge.


Getting started
===============

To get you started on the challenge quickly, we have created some
bootstrapping scripts to make things easier.

In plain language all you need to do is create a virtualenv [#]_ and
run the bootstrap target with make.

A detailed step by step description is:

::

	$ cd 002_fun_coding_time
	$ virtualenv --python=python3 venv
	$ source venv/bin/activate
	$ make bootstrap


Executing run server
====================

To executing the Django run server, executing the following commands:

::

    $ make run

The development server should have started now. You can visit the API
by navigating in a browser to:
`http://localhost:8011/api/v1/MAIN-ENDPOINT/ <http://localhost:8011/api/v1/MAIN-ENDPOINT/>`_.


Testing
=======

To run your tests, executing the following commands:

::

    $ make test

To run the test suite against all support Python versions (2.7 and 3.5),
executing the following commands:

::

    $ make test-all


Docs
====

Documentation is generated by `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_. If
you are unfamiliar with it, check out this handy
`cheatsheet <https://github.com/ralsina/rst-cheatsheet/blob/master/rst-cheatsheet.rst>`_.

To build the docs and see the docs, after building, executing the following
commands:

::

    $ make docs
